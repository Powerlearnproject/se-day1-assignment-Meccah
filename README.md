Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems that are of high quality. which start from design development testing eployment and maintenance of the software.
enable the creation of software applications in the modern day to communicate, store, retrieve, select, filter. a huge role in music, health, finance, commerce industry

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages  the likes of fotran and C
establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
startstructured programming in 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design - ct=reating high level designs for the user interface and system architecture
Implementation - writing the code according to the designs
Testing - this is to ensure the system meets the quality standards.
Deployment - release it to the clients
Maintenance - providing support, enhancement and updates for the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is sequential and follows a specific set of stages. flows downwards like a waterfall eg  building a house
Agile is repetitive and incremental eg  farming

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality assurance Engineer -  he ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager - oversees planning, executing and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing , debugging and testing code making it easy for the software developer to program.
VCS are tools that are used for tracking changes to the  code and collaborate amoung teams

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - solution is making sure you read and are updated on any new thing in the market
Tight deadline - creating a schedule for your self and tasks and sharing knowledge and asking questions
technical debt - regular tasks and having to learn the principles

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing - test interaction between different components
system testing - test the whole system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - test to u=ensure it meetss user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
This is to get clear and precise answers that answer accurate questions. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is the best dance.
Give me five examples of the best dance moves, in hiphop from the year 2015 to 2020.
the improved is more efficient because it specifies a specific genre and gives how the dances move were danced, giving the best of those years.
